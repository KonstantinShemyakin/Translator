The java-adn directory of examples is based on a download of the examples from
the book, 
   Java 5.0 Tiger: A Developer's Notebook
   By Brett McLaughlin, David Flanagan
 The programs are available at

The Errors directory contains a slight modification of one of those example
programs. The intent is simply to prove that the parser does not ignore all
errors.
